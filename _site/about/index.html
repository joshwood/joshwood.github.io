  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
  <p>I have been a software developer for many years. After losing inspiration working in &quot;the enterprise&quot; I found myself questioning if I wanted to continue with software at all. The environment slowly makes you resent new technology and question, well... quite simply everything. By chance I was afforded the opportunity to explore some of the new UI frameworks like AngularJS and Ember as possible replacements for legacy JSF front-ends. </p>

<p>Needless to say this took me down the proverbial rabbit hole. Angular blew me away (2 way binding!! really?!) but that was just the beginning.  GruntJS with live reload!!  NodeJS and npm install, Bower, GitHub, GitHub Pages, socket.io, fabric.js, Cordova, Ionic, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Koding, Heroku, and FireBase 3 way binding!? </p>

<p>My God where did all this stuff come from? How long had I been asleep? I was so completely inspired. I wanted in! But I had no idea what to do (honestly still don’t). As I did many years ago with the beta release of Struts (dating myself here) I just started digging through the mountains of code written by people who are otherworldly good. I started to code for fun again (hadn’t done that since I was a kid, GW-BASIC?) and post it in GitHub. Tried to share with co-workers and friends the JavaScript revolution that has been happening. So this blog is just the next step for me. I’d love to find a way to contribute ‘anything’ after so many years of only taking. </p>

<p>So... don&#39;t take that the wrong way. It&#39;s just something I try to keep in mind.</p>
